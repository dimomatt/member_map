# member_map
Idk, pretty simple thing. If anyone feels like improving this for the clout, feel free. It's just a dash app.

Things to do:
1. actively pull the member location lsit from the sheets API
2. make it a blob map, not a bunch of stars
3. add hover info for group member, location, etc
4. make it a cooler basemap?
5. add other info to spreadsheet. (Has a couch?)
